              Traditionally, the academic architecture provides vertical integration within the departments and sometimes within the university. The horizontal integration is missing and very often driven by the individual investigators. In the US, regional clusters are established to facilitate the horizontal conversations. However, very few resulted in sustainable ecosystems.
              <br> <br>
              This is reflected at the conferences, where the tracks are established to offer a venue for this kind of collaborations. However, the success of such initiatives is limited at the best. For ex: How often a physician attends an engineering conference or vice versa?

              War on Cancer was declared 50 years back. What we learned over the years is that it is a multi-faceted challenge. Scientists from all disciplines are focused on contributing to this challenge. In the last decade, NIH initiated new avenues - Physical Science Oncology Networks (PSOC/PSON), etc to significantly improve the underlying mechanisms of the disease. On the other hand, federal research funding is limited and highly competitive in nature. There are technologies within other domains such as physics, chemistry and engineering, when partnered have the potential to fasten the discovery process.
              <br> <br>
              We have identified the right partners in India for a US based investigator. Such a partnership has the potential to reduce the cost and speed up the research.

              Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized every aspect of our lives. It created new verticals: Smart Homes, Smart Cities, Smart Health etc. From tracking children to monitoring the vitals, wearables are integrated into our lives, and showed the power of "tiny gadgets". These gadgets with internet connectivity shown to collect enormous data. The information derived from this data has the capability to answer questions that we never thought of a decade back. It had shown that Apple Watches are capable of saving lives. Can we use these gadgets to improve preventative healthcare and reduce costs? 
              <br> <br>        
              Our experts designed a study to monitor the patients in order to develop preventative strategies. This is a potentially game changer in reducing the healthcare costs but also providing peace of mind to patients.

                Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one such research_strategy that has the power to learn and replace traditional processes. Natural Language Processing, a part of AI is behind numerous applications such as Amazon's Alexa and other devices. It is becoming the true "brain" of these gadgets. Machine learning, another area of AI is improving safety across SmartCity deployments. One of the key challenge for the AI development and deployment is the availability of or creating the training data sets. Original data sets are much more powerful than synthetic sets when developing a Use case such as Licence Plate Recognition (LPR).
                <br> <br>
                We have partnered with offshore investigators in developing a right strategy for the development and deployment of AI based LPR systems.
